# ATasteOfDataScience
Working an example of supervised machine learning in Python

-------

Supporting material for workshop on beginning data science in Python. Used as follow-up material to lecture.

Our exercises: on the laptop

  * Small scale idealized examples on your machine in Python using the CPU (not a GPU or a TPU).
  * Link: https://github.com/WinVector/ATasteOfDataScience , however this is intended for a live guided session.
  * Goal: play with the code and concepts
  * An experience you learn from, and move on from 


Industry practice: in the factory

  * Large scale examples only runnable in production systems including TPUs and remote services / storage buckets.
  * Examples: https://www.fast.ai , https://www.kaggle.com , https://www.tensorflow.org/hub
  * Goal: operational experience in target systems 
  * An environment to work in
