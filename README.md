# ATasteOfDataScience
Working an example of supervised machine learning in Python

-------

Supporting material for workshop on beginning data science in Python. Used as follow-up material to lecture.

Course purpose:

  * An overview, followed by a vertical deep dive into what data science is like and how data scientists work
  * This can serve as an introduction to data science tools and tasks, or as a guide how to provision for and work with data scientists and data science tools 
  * Or: give a team days of data science tools experience in hours, by using guided examples

Our exercises: on the laptop

  * Small scale idealized examples on your machine in Python using the CPU (not a GPU or a TPU)
  * Link: https://github.com/WinVector/ATasteOfDataScience , however **this is intended for a live guided session** (with detialed slides/hand-outs)
  * Goal: play with the code and concepts
  * An experience you learn from, and move on from 


Industry practice: in the factory

  * Large scale examples only runnable in production systems including TPUs and remote services / storage buckets
  * Examples: https://www.fast.ai , https://www.kaggle.com , https://www.tensorflow.org/hub
  * Goal: operational experience in target systems 
  * An environment to work in
